*90 degree orientation difference, 0.1992 x difference, 0.6572 y difference, 0.5 z difference

Notes: 
-error oscillation present
-simualtion visualizes the oscillation through jerky movements 
-appears the final placement of the cube may be slightly off in orientation
-in the video, I had to increase the timing because recording slows my coppeliasim down a ton, looks a lot nicer in real-time mode without recording.
